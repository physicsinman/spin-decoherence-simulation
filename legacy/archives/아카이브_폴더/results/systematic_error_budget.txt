Systematic Error Budget for MN Slope
========================================

Measured Slope: -0.9852 ± 0.0086
Theoretical Slope: -1.0000
Total Deviation: 1.48%

Error Sources:
1. Statistical Uncertainty: 0.86%
   - Finite ensemble size (N_traj = 2000)
   - Finite data points (N = 5)
   - Bootstrap resampling variance

2. Systematic Deviation: 0.62%
   - Crossover regime contamination (~0.5-1.0%)
   - Numerical discretization (~0.2-0.5%)
   - Fitting window selection (~0.1-0.3%)
   - Model selection (~0.1-0.2%)

3. Combined Uncertainty: 1.06%
   - Root sum of squares (RSS) of all sources

Conclusion:
  Total deviation (1.48%) is exceeds 
  combined uncertainty (1.06%).
  Additional systematic error sources may be present.
